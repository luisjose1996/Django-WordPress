Since the November elections, our <a title="Sunlight Foundation's Politwoops" href="http://politwoops.sunlightfoundation.com/" target="_blank">Politwoops</a> project has kept an eye on how members of Congress and candidates communicate with the public through Twitter. We catch the tweets they hoped you didn't see and surface any deletions that aren't simply a mispelling, broken link or a retweet that the original person removed. We do this to comply with Twitter's terms of service, but also to keep the site a clearly moderated window into the messaging world of political campaigns and power in Washington.

Throughout 2012 campaigns amassed followers and utilized Twitter as another medium to encourage votes for each candidate. Following the election these accounts take any number of turns, some becoming campaign accounts of the newly elected members, some transitioning to personal accounts for unsuccessful candidates and others deleted completely. As the 113th Congress is sworn in, let's review a few fun examples.

Many losing campaigns took the easy way out with an unceremonious deletion, wiping any and all trace of unsuccessful bids for office. These include:
<ul>
    <li>Brendan Doherty (Republican candidate, RI-1) - deleted account <a title="Twitter: @Doherty2012" href="https://twitter.com/Doherty2012" target="_blank">@Doherty2012</a> on December 8th</li>
    <li>Dan Sebring (Republican candidate, WI-4) - deleted account <a title="Twitter: @NoMoore2012" href="https://twitter.com/NoMoore2012" target="_blank">@NoMoore2012</a> on December 9th</li>
    <li>Dr. Syed Taj (Democratic candidate, MI-11) - deleted account <a title="Twitter: @TajforCongress" href="https://twitter.com/TajforCongress" target="_blank">@TajforCongress</a> on December 9th</li>
    <li>Jamie Wall (Democratic candidate, WI-8) - deleted account <a title="Twitter: Wall for Congress" href="https://twitter.com/WallforCongress" target="_blank">@WallforCongress</a> on December 11th</li>
    <li>Pat Kreitlow (Democratic candidate, WI-7) - deleted account <a title="Twitter: @PatKreitlow" href="https://twitter.com/PatKreitlow" target="_blank">@PatKreitlow</a> on December 15th</li>
    <li>Rep. Denny Rehberg (Republican candidate, MT Senate) - deleted account <a title="Twitter: @Rehberg2012" href="https://twitter.com/Rehberg2012" target="_blank">@Rehberg2012</a> on December 16th</li>
    <li>Rep. Denny Rehberg (Republican candidate, MT Senate) - deleted official account <a title="Twitter: @DennyRehberg" href="https://twitter.com/DennyRehberg" target="_blank">@DennyRehberg</a> on December 16th</li>
    <li>Matt Doheny (Republican candidate, NY-21) - deleted official account <a title="Twitter: @Doheny4Congress" href="https://twitter.com/Doheny4Congress" target="_blank">@Doheny4Congress</a> on December 22nd</li>
    <li>Rep. Mary Bono Mack (Republican candidate, CA-25) - deleted official account <a title="Twitter: @Rep_BonoMack" href="https://twitter.com/Rep_BonoMack" target="_blank">@Rep_BonoMack</a> on December 28th</li>
</ul>

Sometimes even winning candidates remove their campaign accounts, as Angus King, the successful independent candidate from Maine, did to his <a title="Twitter: @AngusKing2012" href="https://twitter.com/AngusKing2012" target="_blank">@AngusKing2012</a> account, still <a title="Angus for Maine" href="http://angusformaine.com/" target="_blank">linked to on his campaign site</a>, on December 3rd. Shortly after Election Day, the official <a href="http://politwoops.sunlightfoundation.com/user/TeamRomney" title="Politwoops: @TeamRomney" target="_blank">@TeamRomney</a> account retweeted a question "<a href="http://politwoops.sunlightfoundation.com/tweet/266562312759025664" title="Politwoops: Team Romney (R) @TeamRomney" target="_blank">Is Anton in the Cool Room?</a>" that was quickly removed, but not before we poked around and found this photo of said "<a href="http://via.me/-6qijeac" title="Cool Room" target="_blank">Cool Room</a>."

<a href="http://politwoops.sunlightfoundation.com/user/ForwardTX"><img alt="Screenshots of Paul Sadler&#039;s twitter account changing from his campaign @SadlerTX to @ForwardTX." src="http://assets.sunlightfoundation.com.s3.amazonaws.com/images/blog/posts/sadler-twitter-change.jpg" title="Paul Sadler&#039;s Twitter Change" class="alignleft" img style="border: 0;" width="60%" /></a>The Sunlight Foundation was <a title="Sunlight Foundation: Web-Use Reform Happy Ending" href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2008/10/03/web-use-reform-happy-ending/" target="_blank">instrumental in getting franking rules changed</a> to allow members of Congress to tweet and we're fascinated to watch political messages get crafted and reshaped. One noteworthy shifting of shapes occurred when Paul Sadler, the unsuccessful Democrat who ran for Senate from Texas, slowly deleted his campaign tweets one-by-one and then changed his Twitter handle from @SadlerTX to @ForwardTX, which is now billed as "Progressive opinion and news from the greatest state in the nation" and allowed him to transfer his followers to this new venture. Notice the similarities in the screenshots to the left. In keeping with the Twitter terms of service, since @SadlerTX actively deleted each individual tweet we are able to surface all of his tweets before the makeover - <a href="http://politwoops.sunlightfoundation.com/user/ForwardTX#" title="Politwoops - Paul Sadler" target="_blank">check them out here</a>.

Politwoops was honored as one of the <a href="http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2012/09/18/time-names-politwoops-a-best-website-of-2012/" title="Sunlight Foundation: TIME Names Politwoops a 'Best Website of 2012'" target="_blank">Best Websites of 2012 by TIME Magazine</a> and we look forward to continuing the project in 2013, who knows what deletions will surface! We'll be removing members of Congress who are no longer in power and adding all the new members as soon as possible. Please <a href="mailto:twoops@sunlightfoundation.com">let us know</a> if we missed anyone!]]></content:encoded>
